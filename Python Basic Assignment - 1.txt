1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* - Mathematical Operator
'hello' - String
-87.8 – Integer/Float
- - Mathematical Operator
/ - Mathematical Operator
+	- Mathematical Operator
6 – Integer/Float

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
-> String is a specific data type while Variable is a placeholder which represent computer memory
->Variable can have string or any other datatype and have particular rules for its initialization 

3. Describe three different data types.
-> integer, Float, String, Character, Bool are all native datatype

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Python expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Expression may perform computation while statement is part of code that performs action or actions mentioned in it

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
The value will be 22

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Both will be ‘spamspamspam’

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Because Variable cannot be start with numerical value

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Int(), float(), str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
It can be fixed by making 99 as  int form by ‘99’ or str(99)
